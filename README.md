This is a simple personal portfolio website I created to showcase and blogging. 

I like vanilla HTML/CSS.

Currently the blog system is redirected to a Open-sourced blog solution called "Digital Garden" which is only semi-usable under Cloudflare page without further tweaking. I might try to build another one from scratch some time later to learn more about the structure of a dynamic website.
